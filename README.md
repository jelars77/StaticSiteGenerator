Static Site Generator project from Boot.dev

A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files).

Static vs Dynamic Sites
A static site is what it sounds like... static. The content is always the same. Users can not:

Upload files
Log in
Leave comments
Save preferences
You would need a dynamic site for that stuff, which is usually powered by a database and a custom web server. Static sites are great for:

Blogs
Portfolios
Landing pages
Documentation
